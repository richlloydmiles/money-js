Individual values are console logged to give an idea of how it works (already its very straight forward) - 
eventually one of the select box values will be replaced with the http://freegeoip.net/json/ json feed so that it is not selected by the user.

I have also put static values in for various currencies, however, the functionality for querying the live api has merely been commented out as I do not want to reveal our priuvate key on github. If you want it to pull in the live feed then you must substitute the key (which I can give you) for [YOUR APP ID] in the code , and then uncomment the whole json section.
